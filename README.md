## My Personal Website

For my personal website, I decided to create an interactive resume in a simple timeline format. You can view the website [here](http://nikhilsrivastava.com).

grid.js transforms the resume content located in gridContent.js into a set of tiles located on a grid (styled using simplegrid.css). Each tile is tied to a dropdown and tagged with one or more hotwords that highlight at the top of the page.

events.js ties the hover, click, and highlight events to the grid tiles and hotwords.
