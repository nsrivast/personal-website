## My Personal Website

For my personal website, I decided to create an interactive resume in a simple timeline format. You can view the website [here](http://nikhilsrivastava.com).

The core functionality is in grid.js, which transforms the resume copy and design parameters located in content.js into a set of tiles located on a grid. Each tile is tied to a dropdown and tagged with one or more hotwords that highlight at the top of the page.
